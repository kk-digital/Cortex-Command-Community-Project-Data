AddScene = Scene
	PresetName = Croco Cave
	Description = This large, stony cave is aptly named after the jaws of a crocodile - a fearsome animal from humanity's homeworld. The cave lives up to its intimidating name, since its dense rock walls, and massive tooth-shaped boulders make it extremely difficult to penetrate with conventional mining equipment.
